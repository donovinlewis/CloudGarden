Compilation Notes:
main.ino is the main file which is ran through the Arduino IDE or Visual Studio Code with the Arduino plug in (if serial port selection is working).
All other files should either be added to a folder in the Arduino/libraries folder on your computer or in the same folder in VS Code.
